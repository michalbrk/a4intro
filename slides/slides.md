# Components and interaction

---

# Components

* Building blocks you compose UI from

* Consist of template, controller, and styles

* React on user interactions

* Communicate each other to provide complex look and feel 

---

# First Component

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-editor',
  templateUrl: './editor.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./editor.component.css'],
})
export class EditorComponent implements OnInit {


    constructor(public editorState: EditorStateService) {
    }

    ngOnInit() {
    }

}
```
---

# Task #3

1. Generate `EditorComponent` with:

    ```bash
    > ng gnerate component EditorComponent
    ```

2. Write a template and CSS stylesheet so the component provides a two-column layout for our editor

3. Columns should contain nothing but simple strings: "Left column" and "Right
   column"

4. Make use of the new component in the app component
